# AI-Histrography-M6
The AiHistrography project is an AI-based image classification system that uses a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically categorize historical images or artifacts. It leverages image augmentation techniques to improve accuracy and provides evaluation metrics like confusion matrices and classification reports for performance analysis.
